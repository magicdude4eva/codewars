![CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/magicdude4eva/badges/large)

### Introduction
[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/r/xfz--w) is an educational online platform for computer programming. On
the platform, users aka "*codewarriors*" try to solve programming challenges known as "*kata*" to
practice programming skills and gain honor points, which represent the level of respect a user has
earned from the community. Each kata is set to a ky≈´ rank, based on its subject area and difficulty.
The harder the kata, the more points. Every new codewarrior is ranked as 8 ky≈´ (Beginner) and can
advance through the ranks by completing kata at or above their rank to reach the final 4th dan (
Master). Ky≈´ indicates the number of degrees away from the master level. This is why they count
downward. Once you reach the master level, we count upward. Enough said... Banzaaaai!

### Disclaimer

- Codewarriors are strongly encouraged not to look at your solutions to Kata until they have completed it themselves or at least took the time to think about their own approaches

* Codewarriors should not submit your solutions as their own

- You will not be accepting contributions of any form to this repo

* Creating a repository like this is discouraged by Codewars

### Vocabulary

- Kata: is an algorithm you have to solve in any programming language you desire

- Kyu: is a digit that determines kata difficulty level as well as the user rank on the platform



### Kata Ranking (kyu)
*source: [Codewars Wiki Honor & Ranks](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Honor-&-Ranks) and [Codewars Wiki Kata Ranking](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Kata-Ranking)*

Ranks are used to indicate progression and difficulty. Code Warriors complete Kata which are assigned a rank, which in turn earns them a higher rank once they complete enough of them. There are two classes of ranks, Kyu and Dan. You begin with Kyu at level 8 and work your way down to level 1. Then you progress to Dan, where you work your way up from level 1 to level 8.

#### **1 kyu** kata represent a proficient programming level.

At this level kata are similar to 2 kyu but more challenging. They may include concepts such as:
* Advanced AI/machine learning algorithms
* Complex interpreters and compilers
* Complex Mini-programs with multiple feature requirements (such as a complete markdown parser)

#### **2 kyu** kata represent a proficient programming level.

At this level kata require a mature understanding of complex programming concepts - concepts such as:
* Complex AI/machine learning algorithms
* Reverse engineering techniques
* Basic interpreters and compilers
* Basic mini-programs with multiple feature requirements (such as a basic markdown parser)

#### **3 kyu** kata represent a competent programming level.

At this level the kata are similar to 4 kyu but are more challenging. They include tasks that may handle:
* Computer science concepts utilizing advanced algorithms
* Ability to implement advanced requirements in a scalable fashion
* Basic AI/machine learning algorithms
* Detailed usage of advanced concepts such as concurrency, parallelism and cryptography

#### **4 kyu** kata represent a competent programming level.

At this level the kata begin to take some serious thought to complete. They include tasks that may handle:
* Computer science concepts utilizing complex algorithms
* Advanced design patterns
* Understanding intricate business requirements
* Advanced concepts such as concurrency, parallelism, meta programming and cryptography

#### **5 kyu** kata represent a novice programming level.

At this level the kata are similar to 6 kyu but more challenging. It includes:
* Complex language features that require mature OOP/Functional concepts
* Advanced OOP/Functional concepts
* Complex Design Patterns
* Advanced regular expression usage

#### **6 kyu** kata represent a novice programming level.

At this level the kata will start to include more advanced algorithmic challenges and more complex language features. It includes:
* Complex language features (closures, scopes, monads, etc)
* Complex OOP/Functional concepts
* Basic Design Patterns
* Complex Regular Expressions

#### **7 kyu** kata represent a beginner programming level.

At this level the kata will generally challenge users on their core language and API reference knowledge. Tasks such as:
* Iterating arrays and returning a subset of values
* Basic data type manipulations
* Basic functional or object-oriented concepts
* Basic Regular Expressions

#### **8 kyu** kata represent a beginner level.

At this level the kata is only challenging for users new to programming. This includes programming tasks such as:
* Defining a simple function (i.e. hello world)
* Basic variable assignments
* Fixing basic syntax issues
* Trivial algorithms such as basic if/else statements
